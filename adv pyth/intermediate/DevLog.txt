----Functions
What to learn.
So your status for Day 1:
Task	Status
Function basics	✔️ Completed
Positional args	✔️ Completed
Keyword args	✔️ Completed
Default args	✔️ Completed
*args	✔️ Completed
**kwargs	✔️ Completed
Mixed usage	✔️ Completed
Return vs print understanding	✔️ Completed
Practiced 6–10 functions	✔️ Completed
Applicative order	⛔ Not done yet
Create notes_functions.py	⚠️ Partially done (needs skeleton)

What I Learned
•	Variadic Arguments
o	*args collects extra positional arguments into a tuple.
o	**kwargs collects extra keyword arguments into a dictionary.
o	Useful when building flexible functions like your officers_details() example.
•	Why return showed only one output but print showed all
o	A function can only return one value once — the moment return runs, the function stops.
o	print() can run multiple times inside the loop, so each key–value pair gets printed.
o	If you want to return everything, you must build a single object (like a string or dict) and return that.
•	Applicative Order (Python Evaluation Rule)
o	Python evaluates all arguments first before calling the function.
o	Example:
o	func(a(), b())
a() and b() are evaluated before func runs.
o	Helps you understand why some functions run earlier than expected.
•	Notes App Skeleton
o	You created the base structure:
o	def addNote():
o	    pass
o	
o	def listNotes():
o	    pass
o	
o	def deleteNotes():
o	    pass
o	Ready for the next part: adding the applicative logic (how everything connects).
________________________________________
What Challenged Me
•	Grasping the difference between print() vs return in a loop.
•	Fully understanding how Python evaluates arguments before calling the main function.
•	Moving from function skeleton to full application logic in the Notes App.

Next Step
1.	Add proper logic inside:
o	addNote()
o	listNotes()
o	deleteNotes()
2.	Store notes in a list or dictionary.
3.	Make a menu interface:
o	Add note
o	View notes
o	Delete note
o	Exit
4.	Practice building functions that use *args and **kwargs.

Reflection
Today’s progress shows deeper clarity in function behavior and argument evaluation. You're now understanding not just what Python does — but why it behaves that way. The Notes App project will push you into real-world logic flow, which is the bridge from beginner to intermediate Python.
